# Vessel Maintainability and Performance Guide

This document captures prioritized, actionable recommendations to make Vessel easier to maintain and faster in practice. It’s organized so you can apply improvements incrementally.

## High‑Impact Performance
- Reuse floating-paste canvas: In `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`, don’t create a canvas per frame for floating paste. Keep a single `pasteCanvas` in a ref, resize as needed.
- Floating paste transforms: `FloatingPasteOverlay` now reuses the shared rect-handle math so pasted bitmaps can be positioned and resized interactively before committing. Any future transform affordances should plug into this overlay rather than bolting custom hit testing onto the canvas.
- Reduce full recompositions: Drive `compositeLayersToCanvas` only when a compact layer change hash changes (id, visible, opacity, imageData version). Avoid recomposing on every color‑cycle frame; overlay animated CC layers atop a cached composite when possible.
- Offload palette/gradient work: Use `src/lib/performance/GradientWorkerManager.ts` + `src/workers/gradientWorker.ts` for gradient generation and palette shifting everywhere (avoid synchronous paths).
- OffscreenCanvas/ImageBitmap: Integrate `src/lib/performance/OffscreenRenderer.ts` and `src/lib/performance/ImageBitmapTransfer.ts` in render/composite paths when supported to reduce main‑thread blocking.
- Throttle pointer work with RAF: Keep pointer handlers minimal; subscribe only to needed store slices. Ensure no excessive store reads per move.
- Strip dev logging in prod: Gate logs via `src/utils/debug.ts` and remove raw `console.*` in hot paths. Ensure they’re dead-code-eliminated in production.

### Debug logging controls (dev-only)
- Default excluded scopes: `composite`, `cc-render` (quiet by default to avoid floods).
- Enable scopes: `localStorage.setItem('TB_DEBUG', 'layers,undo')`
- Enable all (respects excludes): `localStorage.setItem('TB_DEBUG', 'all')`
- Force include excluded scopes: `localStorage.setItem('TB_DEBUG_FORCE', 'composite,cc-render')` or `'all'`
- Add exclusions: `localStorage.setItem('TB_DEBUG_EXCLUDE', 'scope1,scope2')`
- Kill switch (off): `localStorage.setItem('TB_DEBUG', 'off')`

## State Management (Zustand)
- Split the monolithic store: Break `src/stores/useAppStore.ts` into slices (project, canvas, tools, layers, ui, history, autosave, customBrushes). Compose with Zustand’s slice pattern for readability and testability.
- Add `subscribeWithSelector`: Wrap the store with `subscribeWithSelector` to reduce re‑renders and enable fine‑grained selectors. Export typed selectors (e.g., `useActiveLayer`, `useCanvasTransform`).
- Use shallow + narrow selectors: In components like `DrawingCanvas`, select only what’s needed (e.g., `tools.currentTool`, `tools.brushSettings.brushShape`) with shallow equality to avoid re-renders.
- Avoid `getState()` in UI: Prefer selectors/hooks. Use refs for imperative needs; reserve `getState()` for store/util layers.
- Enforce layer invariants: Create typed guards/helpers to preserve color‑cycle invariants (layerType ↔ colorCycleData). Replace ad hoc console errors/debuggers with consistent checks.

## Rendering Pipeline
- Checkerboard background: Use a memoized pattern canvas or CSS background on the wrapper instead of filling the checkerboard each frame.
- IndexBuffer efficiency: Reuse a single `ImageData` buffer for `putImageData`; avoid per‑frame `createImageData` where possible.
- Consolidate color‑cycle path: Ensure a single color‑cycle renderer/animator path is used; avoid mixed setTimeout + RAF scheduling. Respect target FPS and event backpressure.
- Avoid object churn: Cache `Path2D` and other objects during shape tools; invalidate only on state changes.
- Foreground-derived CC gradients: when FG-derived key is unchanged, skip slot/palette updates to avoid per-pointer `updateLayer` churn (see `src/hooks/useDrawingHandlers.ts`).

## Type Safety & Code Quality
- Replace `any`/casts in hot paths: Define a shared `ColorCycleData` interface and `ColorCycleBrushImplementation` and use across store/components/hooks.
- Expand type coverage: Introduce `tsconfig.worker.json` and `tsconfig.jest.json` so workers and tests are type‑checked without impacting app builds.
- Lint rules: Enforce no raw `console.*` in `src/` (allow `debugLog`), ban `useAppStore.getState()` in components, prefer named imports, and ensure consistent path aliases.

## Next.js & Build
- Production logging strip: Wrap debug usage with `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or a static flag so SWC eliminates it in prod.
- Bundle analysis: Add `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect bundle; use tree‑shaken imports (lucide icons, `@heroui/*`) to prevent pulling unused code.
- Static export compatibility: Keep test/demo pages out of production export or guard them as dev‑only. Validate `basePath`/`assetPrefix` under `/vessel`.

## Testing
- Store invariants tests: Validate that color‑cycle layers retain `layerType` and `colorCycleData` across add/update/remove/undo/redo.
- Performance micro‑tests: Add tests/benches for IndexBuffer serialization and worker round‑trip latency to catch regressions.
- UI tests: Layer list interactions (visibility, reorder), brush switching size restoration (custom ↔ regular), selection lifecycle.

## Quick Wins Checklist
- [ ] Replace raw `console.*` with `debugLog` and gate via env.
- [ ] Reuse floating‑paste canvas and checkerboard pattern canvas refs.
- [ ] Wire `subscribeWithSelector` and migrate key components to minimal selectors.
- [ ] Split `useAppStore.ts` into slices without behavior changes.
- [ ] Route all gradient/palette computations through the worker manager where safe.

## Suggested Adoption Plan (Incremental)
1) Logging and selectors (low risk)
   - Centralize logging via `debugLog`, add lint rule to prevent raw console usage.
   - Add `subscribeWithSelector`; convert `DrawingCanvas` and `MinimalLayerList` to narrow, shallow selectors.

2) Canvas reuse and composite dirtiness (medium)
   - Add refs for floating‑paste and checkerboard pattern canvases.
   - Introduce a concise `layersHash` that includes an imageData version counter and only recomposite on changes.

3) Workerization and offscreen integration (medium)
   - Ensure gradient/palette updates use `GradientWorkerManager` where synchronous code remains.
   - Integrate `OffscreenRenderer`/`ImageBitmapTransfer` when supported.

4) Store slices and invariants (higher‑touch)
   - Extract slices; add typed invariants with tests for color‑cycle layers and undo/redo flows.

5) Build & bundle hygiene (ongoing)
   - Add bundle analyzer, trim imports, and keep static export guards intact.
